# Preprocessing
Basic preprocessing

train-test-split: test that one individual has one label

using an imagefolder dataset, aka not specifying a csv_file

# Training
- Resuming runs
- multi-GPU

# Prediction

"Normal" prediction

Feature extraction
    - pooled
    - non-pooled

# Prediction processing

# Grouping 

- full cv
- single fold
    - invalid fold

- Single fold has been grouped but user wants to combine the predictions

# Evaluation

- bootstrapping
- no bootstrapping
